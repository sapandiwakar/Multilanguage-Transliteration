/*	Documentation for the C API  which supports the SSF FORMAT  along with CMF-format/multiple sentence tag, format :::: written by M.R.Chethan , 2007-08	*/

Backup c_api_v2 :
----------------

	Firstly make a backup of the previous c_api_v2 ( if u have one which is used for only single sentence without sentence tag set) otherwise copy all the files of folder : C_API_files_for_multipleSentence_n_CML into the location where your are keeping your c modules.
 
	Now,u are ready to access the C API for  multiple Sentence/CML (as usually by using the previous methods except for few changes if u have already used capi with single sentence.)



The folder of <include_files>_for_C_API_for_ multipleSentence_CML having following files:-
	structures.h-------all structures used
	core_functions.h---Some very important functions
	ssf_functions.h----functions involving for ssf structures ( without fs )
	fs_functions.h-----functions to act on feature structures
